    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If the wakeup time is seven or less, you’ll reach the bus. If its more like for example 8, you’ll miss the bus.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If the wakeup time is seven I can take the bus if its more like 8 I can still take the car]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[Now it states that if I wake at seven I can take the bus. If I wake up at eight I can take the train and otherwise I can drive.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
    </ol>
    [Although ive made it so that it only states the number is zero, it earlier stated that zero is positive]
