      <li>[What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, 
        typically of the same type, in a contiguous block of memory. 
        The elements are accessed by their index, starting from 0.]</p>
      <li>[What does "hardcode" mean in programming?]</li>
      <p>[Hardcoding means embedding fixed values directly into the code rather than using variables,
         configurations, or external inputs, making the code less flexible and harder to maintain.]</p>
      <li>[Explanation of task 3]</li>
      <p>[In task 3, the string is split into an array of words using split(" ").
        We iterate through the array using forEach, which processes each word along with its index.
        When the array length is unknown, we can rely on methods like forEach or length to iterate over all elements dynamically.]</p>
      <li>[Why store class instances in arrays?]</li>
      <p>[Storing class instances in arrays allows efficient grouping, retrieval,
        and manipulation of related objects, enabling operations like iteration, filtering, or sorting on a collection of objects.]</p>

      <li>[Callback routine in task 8]</li>
      <p>[A callback routine is a function passed as an argument to another function (e.g., sort).
        The callback is executed during the sorting process to determine the order of elements,
        comparing pairs and returning a positive, negative, or zero value.]</p>
